//   ***  bird story below ***
// Fearless Approach to Bird Conservation
// American Bird Conservancy was born in 1994, based on the need our founder, George Fenwick, saw for a fearless bird conservation group — one that wasn't afraid to take on difficult issues like free-roaming cats and pesticides.

// Choosing the small but feisty hummingbird as its symbol, ABC has gone on to become known for our results and ability to leverage still great accomplishments through partnerships.

// A Future Where Birds are Valued
// In our 20 + years, we have found that when it comes to bird conservation, fearlessness and persistence pay off.Today, we can imagine a world in which our Vision Statement becomes reality:

// “An Americas - wide landscape where diverse interests collaborate to ensure that native bird species and their habitats are protected … where their protection is valued by society … and where they are routinely considered in all land - use and policy decision - making.”
